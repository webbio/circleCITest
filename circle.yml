  # This _should_ be inferred by Circle CI as we specify a node version but for some reason, it never ran for me. This tells it explicitly to run.

    commands:
      # This is just an ansible playbook command with some options to specify where the host file is located and that we want to skip tasks with the tag `skip-using-ci`
